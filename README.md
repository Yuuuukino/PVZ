# PVZ课设作业

按空格键可以暂停

有两个main函数，main.py有bug：暂停游戏阳光继续下落

play里的exe是main.py打包的

main(2).txt是修复上述bug后的主函数(但是我懒得再打包了，所以exe还是上个版本的)

顺带一提，如果不是main函数的bug，应该是无法通关的(反正我过不去)

感谢当初找出这个bug的同学，于是我将bug做成了彩蛋(其实是懒得再打包，笑)

Homework for PVZ

Press the space bar to pause

There are two main functions, main.py, which have a bug: pause the game and the sun continues to fall

The EXE in play is packaged with main.py

Main (2).txt is the main function after fixing the above bug (but I'm too lazy to pack any more, so the exe is the last version)

By the way, if it wasn't for a bug in main, it would have been impossible (I couldn't get through anyway).

Thanks to the students who found this bug, so I made the bug into an Easter egg (in fact, it is too lazy to pack again, laugh).

Thanks for Searching bugs!!

(OF course I know there are many bugs! But you have to know that a person's ability is limited!
